# Data-Science-Mind-Map

Hierarchical concept map of Data Science. 

TAKE A LOOK http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SaFialhoD/Data-Science-Mind-Map/blob/master/Index.html

The goal of this map is to create a summary of how a hierarchical relationship of Data Science´s concepts could be, while allowing access to its content. 

Edges (Relationships):

	•	Abstract. Since most relationships are abstract and ambiguous, this mind map is to be viewed as an approximation.
	•	Hierarchical. Because it is made only by hierarchical relationships there is redundancy. (Some nodes/branches repeating)

Nodes (Concepts):

	•	Abstract. Information, examples, source code and so on, are not of my authorship(high effort to respect and reference authorship). The process of choosing and interpreting the nodes can also be abstract and ambiguous. Thereby viewed as an approximation.

Continuous improvement:

	•	To reduce its own contradictions. As a result of continuous improvement.
	•	As an exercise. Looking forward to learning and keep learning. 
	•	For content clarification. It intends to reflect different levels of abstraction. 

People are invited to participate in this process!

To do:

In its presentation:

	  Update the code to ease the data manipulation for working purposes.
	  Update the code to ease the data navigation for experience purposes.
In its content:

 	 Continous improvement.
 	 Review hierarchical relations. Get feedback.
 	 Update and complete References(Most important for now).
 	 Update and complete images, examples, code and pros and cons.
